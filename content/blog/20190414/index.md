[That is a path I use to reach cave](mapa-turystyczna.pl/route/awbz)

Mapaturystyczna will be helpful to find the Komoniecki's cave. It will show unmarked forest paths.
I left my car at the shops parking (in Poland they are closed on Sundays). Or there is a church very close, so you can leave a car there.

The main goal is to find Soliska street and follow it, but there are many places where you can miss the correct path, so I recommend using mapaturystyczna in places where you are not sure.

The cave is very nice, although not that deep or big. Additionally there is a largest (big word) waterfall in Little Beskids [Dusiołek](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusio%C5%82ek_(wodospad)) nearby.

There is a path that leads from the cave to [Rozstaje pod Łamaną Skałą](https://mapa-turystyczna.pl/node/rozstaje-pod-lamana-skala). Some of the trees have a symbol on them [(something like this)](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/2748982/appearance_form_formation_geomatric_half_circle_shapes_icon). So it is easier to follow, however, these sighs are very rare.

Additionally, on this trip, we did visit student hut [Chatka na Potrójnej](http://www.potrojna.com.pl/). It's a place worth visiting.

Another point of interest in the area is [Zbójeckie Okno](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zb%C3%B3jeckie_Okno) , which you can translate to 'a rogue window'. It is a very nice rock formation.

We used the normal trail (PTTK one) to get back to the car.
