After a scary night at Przysłop let's go forward.

In Węgierska Górka you can eat something, but after it, the next opportunity is on a Rysianka, unless Słowianka is open.

On Abramów I met a lady that also follow GSB, and we were going together for the rest of the day.

Again, night in a tent, this time without problems.

Photo is from another trip. I was raining almost whole day.
