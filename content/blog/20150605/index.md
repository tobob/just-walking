2nd Chłosta Beskidzka, but the first edition we participate in.

I posted a recommended path, but we won't be able to reach Krawców Wierch, because we get lost at Bory Orawskie. We took asphalt to get to Ujsoły.

It was our first long trip. It was exhausting. Very exhausting, the last 4km was slowly dying.

But it was worth it, for sure.

And I will remember the name of my friend's dog - Afron!
