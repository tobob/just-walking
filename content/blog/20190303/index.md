A nice trip with my brother. Yea, I know, too many selfies.. My brother was bussy doing some of his breathing exercises, so I was quite bored.

But rules are simple, there needs to be at least one photo without a face. There is! Back of my brother.

Czupel is a mountain that is very close to my heart. It is very easy to reach if you follow the black trail.
