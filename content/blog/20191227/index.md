Równica is easy to reach, you can get there even using a car. In a summer, more warmer days, there is plenty of people there. Additionally, if you want to eat something good, there are about 4 places where you can do it, each better then previously. However, several paths lead to it. You can make a little loop starting in Ustroń and finishing in Ustroń but in another district. Then you need to follow some paths by Vistula river, to get back to the car.
