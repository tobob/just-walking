First of all, we lost at the very begging and we need to go through the forest to get to the red path.

Before reaching Barania the weather was good, but after it starts raining.

We met zigzag snake. The only polish venomous snake.

Near Fajkówka we realize that the green path is closed because of highway building and at the same time we were attacked by a dog from the near house. It reaps by trousers and I punched it in the face. That was a very scary situation because this dog was huge.

We decided to go down to the Kamesznica and follow Soła river back to Węgierska Górka - there are many small paths near that river you can follow.
