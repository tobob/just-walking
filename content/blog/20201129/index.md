That was stupid.
I don't like Tatra, they are a bit dangerous, especially in winter.

It was first big snow this season. I was not prepared for this. There was like 30cm fresh snow on a path that was not visible under this. We follow 2 other guys that was waling first and they lost path...

Plan was a bit different, but we decide to get same path back, because there was no way to find way back by going down to Siklawa.
