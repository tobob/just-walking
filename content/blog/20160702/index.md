It was a rainy day and I had time, so I decide to make a short day.

My destination was [OW Smerek](https://g.page/OWSmerek?share), I was sleeping there on a first GSB. They have a big garden where you can place a tent. They have one playlist there - Stare Dobre Małeństo.

I did but a whole package of cigarettes in Smerek.. shame on me.
