Świeradów Zdrój is a nice city, for sure worth visiting.

This time it was only a starting point.

I purchased water, ate dinner and I was ready to go. I thought that reaching the first mountain will be easy, but getting to top pissed me off, don't know why Stóg is not a big mountain. Probably then I realize, that I need to walk for the next 2 weeks.

There is no option to use a tent near the shelter, but I was lucky to get a room.
