I don't recommend Igliczna shelter, it should have the name 'Igliczna café'.

After a whole day of walking, I was dreaming about food that I will eat there. I was on a ketogenic diet, and there never was a problem with eating something in shelters - like eg. scumbled eggs. In Igliczna shelter you can order chips, open-faced toasted cheese sandwich or biscuits..

I filled my belly in Międzygórze. Reaching Śnieżnik was easy then.
