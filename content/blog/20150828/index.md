After filling resources in Jordanów and nice time visiting restaurants there I follow.

In Jordanów I have a nice night base - [you can check here](http://www.strumyk-wczasy.com.pl/baza-noclegowa-2.html). I highly recommend this one, they also have a restaurant.

The day was long, reaching Babia was hard, however after making about a minimum 30 km each day it was not a big deal.
