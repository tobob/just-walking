One of the best trips in 2019, it turns out that going from Goleszów to Czantoria was a very good idea. 
I did leave my car near the school and start hiking. First, there is a bunch of asphalt, additionally, we pass old [ski jumping hill](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompleks_skoczni_narciarskich_w_Goleszowie) and even [shooting range](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Gun-Range/Strzelnica-Golesz%C3%B3w-168336483945049/) so don't be worry if you hear such noises. 

The weather this time was a very nice one. Clear sky and nice sun. However the path is quite long, so you can't start it in the middle of the day, because it takes time to complete.

I was not at the summit of Czantoria, I was there so many times. So additional 30minutes was not worth seeing it. A better view is from the Small Czantoria summit. 

I very recommend this path, for most of the time, there were none of the people. On the summit, you can eat something in the Restaurant.
