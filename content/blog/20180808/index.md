I was passing Krzeszów - there is a big [basylic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_the_Assumption_of_the_Blessed_Virgin_Mary,_Krzesz%C3%B3w) there. It looks nice, but a restaurant in that complex sounds nicer. That makes me smile - when you walking long distances and you see an open restaurant in the morning.

With a full belly, I kept going.

There was a problem in a storm that was coming (and never comes). The Bukowiec approach was very fast, that's why I hate this mountain, it was a very exhausting part of a day (you can see on selfies).

I need to tell something - Andrzejówka is number one in my shelter ranking. This shelter is just beautiful.

I spend a night in a tent, but I was enjoying every minute in this place.
