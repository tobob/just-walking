I think that this path is the best way to get to Babia for me:

1. Where is plenty of spots where I can leave a car.
2. Parking is free
3. Enterint into National Park is free
4. Path is less tilting
5. There are like many view points (when you start from Krowiarki you see only forest)
6. It is faster for me to get to Slana Voda rather then Zawoja

So I highly recommend
