Very nice and easy trip on Medralowa - second name is Big (Great) Jałowiec. There is a small hut at the top, very nice, you can rest there.

Path from Przyborów to Medralowa should be called cherry path, because there is a lot of wild cherry trees there.

Next time I will start earlier, because reaching Babia from this path is very easy.
