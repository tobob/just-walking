I started from Radków, so I need to reach the red path [check map](https://mapa-turystyczna.pl/route/a747).

I saw a tiny piece of table mountains.
I ate something in Kudowa Zdrój, send some postcards.

I found on the map that there should be camping in Lewin Kłodzki so I follow.
In Lewin I asked some lady where I can find this camping, she said that is it was closed about 5 years ago...

I was looking for a single night somewhere. I found it in lovely [resort Maria](https://goo.gl/maps/uL7K65htdjXTkrqo7).

Again, I was not using the original red path and my back it was looking like [this](https://mapa-turystyczna.pl/route/a6nc). So I made additional kilometers in comparison to the original red path.
