Very long and easy trip into Gorce. The weather was great, and spring is wonderful in Poland!

We left a car in Kamienica and follow a red path to Zbludzkie Wierchy, when we went down to Szczawa (they have 2 church!).

Then a long walk by asphalt and we reached Gorc - there is an observation tower on top of it, but there were too many people there. After reaching Gorc we decide to take a bike path down to Zasadne and Wierch Młynne pass. It is easy to get there using mapaturystyczna.pl . After reaching the pass we took a forest path through Żdżar and Bystra. Our goal was to reach the blue path, and we made it. Then we follow the blue path back to Kamienica.
