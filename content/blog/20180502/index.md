It was a very simmilar path I was doing with Grupa Górska Czechowice-Dziedzice, but this time, I did reach Wielki Krywań.

But, this time weather was perfect! There was a little bit snow, but nothing special. My trip reached only Chleb, I was then in perfect condition, so I follow to the top of Wielki Krywań.
