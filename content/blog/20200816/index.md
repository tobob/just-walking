Moravian-Silesian Beskids next round. This time a trip with some people from work.

Czech people love asphalt and were they can they add it.

I was first time in this part of Moriavian Beskids and I kinda like it much. There were plenty of people at the Radhošť, Radegast and Pustevny. Some kind of our polish path to Morskie Oko. But on our path to Čertův Mlýn was very few people.

This part of Czech mountains is very good for normal tourists. They can go up with car or chairlift. And they will have plenty of attractions there. There is a nice walking-in-the-trees platform at Pustevny.
