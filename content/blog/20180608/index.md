This is the 5th edition of Chłosta Beskidzka, that in simple translation means Beskid Flogging.

[This is original route of Chłosta Beskidzka V](https://mapa-turystyczna.pl/route/mujl)

We were not able to do it. Pitty.

We started Friday at about 7 PM. Reaching Hala Boracza from Milówka is not fun at all, a huge amount of asphalt and hilly. Reaching Hala Redykalna is easier after a quick refill on Boracza.

Next mountain is harder - Muńcół - not funny at all.

A quick nap (actually 3 hours) on a Młada Hora with sheep.

Next is quite fast - Przegibek.
Wielka Racza (highest mountain) was no easy task, check photos.

Then we start following the blue path, with hardcore Bednarów Beskid - this mountain rocks!

But then it started raining, even with thunders, so we made a couple of breaks - waiting for the storm to go away.
We didn't reach Oszus - we use mapaturystyczna and follow a forest path to avoid reaching the top.

We were very tired. We had an option - go on the end and sleep in a cold, wet tent or go home by a car that we left in Glinka.

After reaching Jaworzyna we started going down to Glinka by using mapaturystyczna (same as we did under Oszus).
