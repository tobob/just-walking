This was first winter attack this year. I decide to visit Sznurówka (aka Bukowy Groń). You can see on map that there is a path start at the end of my one. I did follow it to Bukowy Groń and then follow to Krzyż Zakochanych and then to Brenna.

Weather was not perfect, I did see nothing special in Bukowy Groń, I will visit it when visibility will be better.
