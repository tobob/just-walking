A year earlier (during GSS) I promise to myself that I will visit Śnieżnik on a separate trip. I did complete this promise.

Międzygórze is a very nice village with great architecture and even a soul.
There are some awesome waterfalls and many places where you can eat.

The trip on Śnieżnik was very peaceful and easy. However, I can add a label milestone to this trip.

### Now some personal shit, you don't need to read this

There are so many things I want to do and words I want to say. But they won't probably change anything.
The decision has been made.
I thought that I'm a strong, wise man. I was nothing but an idiot, naive idiot.

But we should be going forward? Right?
