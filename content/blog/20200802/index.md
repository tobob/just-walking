Moravian-Silesian Beskids are wonderful at this time in a summer. Photos can tell that. But amount of asphalt on this patch was not something good.

Actually bob is a shortcut from bobek - my original nickname. So I was on a mountain that have same name as me.

If you decide to visit Ostrava at the same day you need to add additional point into asphalt score.
