I was checking what Muszyna can offer. There are couple of thinks you can check there. For sure nice city park with the Observational Tower.

There are also a small castle ruins, but they are not huge. You can reach them by following some forest paths.

I decide to visit the biggest mountain, Koziejówka, it was nice.
