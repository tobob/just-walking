We did leave a car in Ustroń Centrum and follow path to peak of Czantoria. First we reached Mała then Wielka, with a launch break near peak.

With bellies (with Langosh) we follow and take another break at Soszów Shelter. Then we follow through Cieslar and take left green path before Stozek.

It end up that next train will be in 2hours, so we take a bus to get back to Ustroń.
