Let's finish it!

After a bad day, this one was awesome! I had wonderful weather and problems with my heel...

I had problems going down, so I was even running up but walking slow down.

I even reached Tarnica (in 2015 I was not on top).

After reaching the end of the path, I did take a small bus to get back to Ustrzyki.

The next day I took a bus to Ustrzyki G贸rne, from where I get to Krak贸w and home.
