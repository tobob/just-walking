Blue path from Złatna to Hala Lipowa is one of the longest way to get there. But this path is very nice, long but not hard.
This whole trip was very easy, something for beginners.

I also very like Krawców Wierch, but visiting this Sunday is not a very good idea - there were stupid amount of people.
