That was an awesome day! Almost without any soul in Saturday! Nice!

Route that is in link is only a piece of whole.

1. I did start in Pewel Mała
2. I did follow to Rychwałdek and then I follow Szkolna street
3. At the end of Szkolna I turned right into Barutka street.
4. I did follow it to the end and then follow up with path that follows through Barytka (622) mountain.
5. I follow path forward and I did reach Ostry Groń (there is a cross at the top and big telecommunications tower)
6. I passed them and follow down to Pewel Slemienska (with Wiosenna street)
7. I then took 2nd route on right (Wilcza) to reach Ubocz
8. When I follow yellow path as in mapaturystyczna link, back to Mutne
9. Then I used shortcut to reach main street and follow back to Pawel Mala going parallel to rails
