I was sleeping in Krynica Zdrój, so I start from the hotel and reached Góra Parkowa (the Park Mountain) by using paths in the park.

Plan was a bit more ambitious, but it turns our that after waiting for and eating the dinner (Cicha Chata - Krynica), I don't have enough time.

But I had time to check the big observation tower - https://wiezawidokowa.pl/. It was fun.
