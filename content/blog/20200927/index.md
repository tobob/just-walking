The forecast was telling that it should be raining that day, but we were lucky. But, it was very cold on that day.

Whole trip and path was very easy, only reaching Ropice and Velký Lipový was harder.

This path is not as beautiful as trip to for example Velký Polom, but in some places you can get nice views.
