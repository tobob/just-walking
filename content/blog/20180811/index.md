I reached the highest mountain early in the morning (about 6 AM). Then the trail was easy, a bit long and full of asphalt.

I was passing by (Fort Srebrna Góra)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Srebrna_G%C3%B3ra] but it was closed. In Wambierzyce there is a nice (Basilica)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_the_Visitation,_Wambierzyce].

Słupiec is a quite big city on a route, kebab was a great breakfast. Even some old man asked me if I'm following Orłowicz Path.

I was sleeping in Radków and this is a path I use to get from Wambierzyce to Radków and from Radków back on the trail.
(check map)[https://mapa-turystyczna.pl/route/a747]
I lost during finding the right path and I ended up using google maps to get to Radków, unfortunately.

(Radków)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radk%C3%B3w] is a very nice city with an old town. It is quite small, but they have nice regional food.

(Camping)[http://camping.gorystolowe.info/] was very nice.
