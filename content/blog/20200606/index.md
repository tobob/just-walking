The map that I posted is not a correct one, because I did skip Zmijowa and Głuszkowa - I did take a shorter path using asphalt - I was worry that I didn't have enough time to finish the whole trip till night.

This whole trip was quite long, I was not expecting to get this amount of kilometers.
What was more strange - I met a small about of people, and this was not a hard or ugly place. Weather was great and vision was perfect, I don't know, maybe Babia.
