At 9 am we start from our hotel, after 4 hours and a short breakfast we are at Londorossi Gate, there we spend additional 1-2 hours, this is a time for measure weights for our porters and we consume our lunch boxes.

#### It is raining, but the adventure begins.

Then we go to Lemosho Gate, where we spend an additional half-hour for a recheck of baggage.
Now we can start hiking, we starting with Rain Forest, it is wet and muddy. Trekking is not hard, we are very fast at a camp, out the first camp - Mti Mkubwa Camp.

Our crew sets up a camp and we register in the camp guest book.

There are 3 small yellow tents. 2 for us, 1 for guide, guide assistant and one of the porter (after a couple of days we start calling him Tomorrow-Morning).

There is one tent where is a kitchen and where the rest of our crew is sleeping (about 12 men in one tent!). There is also a fourth tent where we eat our meals.

We also saw a big blue monkey, your guide said that one of them is crazy and like to steal some items from porters.

After dinner, we went to sleep.
