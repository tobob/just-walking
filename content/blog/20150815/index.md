Let's start with this adventure! Main Beskids Path! For the first time.

As a child, I was there (actually in Cisna). But I don't remember anything as from these times. Additionally, when you spend holidays with your parents as a child you don't hike very hight, so you are not able to see all the best mountains. So when I saw Bieszady for the first time it was amazing.

This day was unlucky because on the first night under the tent I broke a tent's frame.
