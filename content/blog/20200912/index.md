Always check to the end of the possible moment if there is a parking or an option to leave car as fast as possible.
In this case I can leave my car about 1km closer to limit amount of kilometers I took to get to the normal path.

But Ploská and Borišov were amazing. There was too many people to eat in pease in shelter under Borišov, but still, view were astonishing.

There are like old sight about brown bears, so I think it is not a bad idea to take some anti-bear stuff.
