Next day on a trail. After a cold night in a tent and breakfast in Dom Slaski shelter, I left Karkonosze behind.

I refiled supplies in Karpacz and I was going to Bukowiec, where I was hoping to get a night in a youth hostel. Sadly, they told me that they don't have a place, and I can't set up a tent in a hostel backyard.

They told me that there is an agritourism farm on a path to the next village, so I follow.

This was one of the best nights I had in the whole trip. Hosts were very hospitable, so I recommend this place with my whole heart - (Andrzejewski Bogdan. Gospodarstwo agroturystyczne)[https://goo.gl/maps/PDSLgifPeenESxcz5]
