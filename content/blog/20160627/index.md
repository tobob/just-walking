The day started with reaching Rotunda, this is a magical/odd place. I very like it.
I know this is an I world war graveyard, but it looks amazing.

This time distance is a bit shorter, so I'm very early at Bartne. I was waiting for about an hour for an owner.

After all the waiting, I got a room inside, I ate some dinner and went to sleep together with all the bark beetles what eating this hut for years.
