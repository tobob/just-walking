One of the many quick Szyndzielnia tours, about 2-3 hours of trekking and you can tell that you were in the mountains at the weekend.

When you check a map it turns out that I did finish on Cyberniok, I reach its summit and then follow forest paths that lead me back to my parking spot. You can always use mapaturystyczna to find these forest trails, but if you don't like walking off marked paths, I recommend using another route.
