Wow, this is the first post I ever created on this blog,
there will be some info about why am I doing this and so on. However, let's start.

It was a lovely trip to Jałowiec, my first time there and I can tell that it is a very nice mountain.

I left my car near the church, which has a huge parking, should not be a problem to leave a car there. There should be a possibility of getting there by train because Hucisko has a PKP station.

The path was very peaceful, I met about 20 other people on a path, probably because of the amount of snow that was on track.
